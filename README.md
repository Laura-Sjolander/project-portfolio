This week we made a portfolio in HTML and CSS. We had to follow a design file in Figma, to get all the styling such as fontsize, layout, headings and so on, in different media queries. This portfolio is going to be updated through the course of this bootcamp and is not to be considered done at any point. 
You can see the deployed portfolio here
